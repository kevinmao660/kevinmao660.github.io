      <h2 class="h21"><h2>The Cloud</h2>
      <p class="p1"> First, we will have to learn about the cloud before we learn about cloud computing. In the most simple terms the cloud is a place to store digital files or documents in a huge data server far off of your computer's hard drive. In the cloud you can save your videos, photos, music, documents, etc. You can access that media on any device connected to the World Wide Web. There are three types of cloud deployments. They is public, private, and hybrid cloud. The public cloud is owned and operated by a third party and they deliver their storage through the internet. Anyone can access these clouds for their use. Privates cloud refers to the cloud computing of businesses for themselves. For example, if a business has their own cloud for their employees then it is a private cloud. Hybrid cloud is the combination of private and public cloud. Hybrid cloud allows data to be sent to either cloud either way.

        Some benefits of storing your data on a cloud include:
<ul>
  <li>You will never lose any documents if your computer breaks or malfunctions because your files will be saved online.
  </li>
    
<li>If you get a virus on your computer, your data might be erased, but if you backup your files to the cloud, you will still have them.
  </li>
        </ul>

     <h2>Cloud Computing</h2>
<p>
Cloud computing is the delivery service of the cloud. It delivers all your media to the storage servers some place else. It is also the storing of data and applications and accessing them via the internet. There are two ends of the cloud. The front end and the back end. They are connected by the internet. The front end is your side. It represents your computer and how you access the cloud. 
          <br/>

          <ul>
            <li>Cloud computing is fast.</li>
            <li>Cloud computing is not expensive.</li>
